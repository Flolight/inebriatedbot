## Meet him

Hey, this is a bot who will like beers in a neer future !
For now he just writes some "fun" tweets but soon, you will be able to pay him some beers so he can talk with you a bit inebriated !

## Tech stuff

Built with Python (Tweepy) for now...
The bot is running on AWS Lambda and uses the [https://v2.jokeapi.dev](https://v2.jokeapi.dev) API.

## Road map

The roadmap is very abstract for now.

This is a simple experiment. I will try things on this project.

The goal might be to add some AI stuff in the future.
